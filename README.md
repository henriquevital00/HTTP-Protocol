# HTTP Protocol
The main ideia of the project is implement an HTTP Server in Python, including GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods.

# Web Application
We've developed a web app to help the execution of each method simulation.

# GET and DELETE

- To send GET requests, you can use the browser, typing its endpoint in the search bar (example: http://localhost:8000/[filePath]) and it will be rendered.
- You can use API testing tools like Postman and Isomnia or use the terminal to send GET/DELETE requistions 

# Execution
Execute __main__.py file in your IDE
